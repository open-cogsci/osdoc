# class __Keyboard__

The `Keyboard` class is used to collect keyboard responses. You
generally create a `Keyboard` object with the `Keyboard()` factory
function, as described in the section
[Creating a Keyboard](#creating-a-keyboard).

__Example:__

~~~ .python
# Wait for a 'z' or 'x' key with a timeout of 3000 ms
my_keyboard = Keyboard(keylist=['z', 'x'], timeout=3000)
start_time = clock.time()
key, end_time = my_keyboard.get_key()
var.response = key
var.response_time = end_time - start_time

## Things to know

### Creating a Keyboard

You generally create a `Keyboard` with the `Keyboard()` factory function:

~~~ .python
my_keyboard = Keyboard()
~~~

Optionally, you can pass [Response keywords](#response-keywords) to
`Keyboard()` to set the default behavior:

~~~ .python
my_keyboard = Keyboard(timeout=2000)
~~~

### Key names

- Key names may differ between backends.
- Keys can be identified either by character or name, and are
  case-insentive. For example:
  - The key 'a' is represented by 'a' and 'A'
  - The up arrow is represented by 'up' and 'UP'
  - The '/' key is represented by '/', 'slash', and 'SLASH'
  - The spacebar is represented by 'space' and 'SPACE'
- To find out the name of key, you can:
  - Click on the 'list available keys' button of the
    KEYBOARD_RESPONSE item.
  - Collect a key press with a KEYBOARD_RESPONSE item, and display
    the key name through a FEEDBACK item with the text 'You
    pressed [response]' in it.

### Response keywords

Functions that accept `**resp_args` take the following keyword
arguments:

- `timeout` specifies a timeout value in milliseconds, or is set to
  `None` to disable the timeout.
- `keylist` specifies a list of keys that are accepted, or is set to
  `None` accept all keys.

~~~ .python
# Get a left or right arrow press with a timeout of 3000 ms
my_keyboard = Keyboard()
key, time = my_keyboard.get_key(keylist=[u'left', u'right'],
        timeout=3000)
~~~

Response keywords only affect the current operation (except when passed
to [keyboard.\_\_init\_\_][__init__]). To change the behavior for all
subsequent operations, set the response properties directly:

~~~ .python
# Get two key A or B presses with a 5000 ms timeout
my_keyboard = Keyboard()
my_keyboard.keylist = [u'a', u'b']
my_keyboard.timeout = 5000
key1, time1 = my_keyboard.get_key()
key2, time2 = my_keyboard.get_key()
~~~

Or pass the response options to [keyboard.\_\_init\_\_][__init__]:

~~~ .python
# Get two key A or B presses with a 5000 ms timeout
my_keyboard = Keyboard(keylist=[u'a', u'b'], timeout=5000)
key1, time1 = my_keyboard.get_key()
key2, time2 = my_keyboard.get_key()
~~~

<div class="FunctionDoc YAMLDoc" id="Keyboard-flush" markdown="1">

## function __Keyboard\.flush__\(\)

Clears all pending keyboard input, not limited to the keyboard.

__Returns:__

True if a key had been pressed (i.e., if there was something to flush) and False otherwise.

- Type: bool

</div>

<div class="FunctionDoc YAMLDoc" id="Keyboard-get_key" markdown="1">

## function __Keyboard\.get\_key__\(\*\*resp\_args\)

Collects a single key press.

__Example:__

~~~ .python
my_keyboard = Keyboard()
response, timestamp = my_keyboard.get_key(timeout=5000)
if response is None:
        print(u'A timeout occurred!')
~~~

__Keyword dict:__

- `**resp_args`: Optional [response keywords](#response-keywords) (`timeout and `keylist`) that will be used for this call to `Keyboard.get_key()`. This does not affect subsequent operations.

__Returns:__

A `(key, timestamp)` tuple. `key` is None if a timeout occurs.

- Type: tuple

</div>

<div class="FunctionDoc YAMLDoc" id="Keyboard-get_key_release" markdown="1">

## function __Keyboard\.get\_key\_release__\(\*\*resp\_args\)

*New in v3.2.0*

Collects a single key release.

*Important:* This function currently assumes a QWERTY keyboard
layout (unlike `Keyboard.get_key()`). This means that the returned
`key` may be incorrect on non-QWERTY keyboard layouts. In addition,
this function is not implemented for the *psycho* backend.

__Example:__

~~~ .python
my_keyboard = Keyboard()
response, timestamp = my_keyboard.get_key_release(timeout=5000)
if response is None:
        print(u'A timeout occurred!')
~~~

__Keyword dict:__

- `**resp_args`: Optional [response keywords](#response-keywords) (`timeout` and `keylist`) that will be used for this call to `Keyboard.get_key_release()`. This does not affect subsequent operations.

__Returns:__

A `(key, timestamp)` tuple. `key` is None if a timeout occurs.

- Type: tuple

</div>

<div class="FunctionDoc YAMLDoc" id="Keyboard-get_mods" markdown="1">

## function __Keyboard\.get\_mods__\(\)

Returns a list of keyboard moderators (e.g., shift, alt, etc.) that are currently pressed.

__Example:__

~~~ .python
my_keyboard = Keyboard()
moderators = my_keyboard.get_mods()
if u'shift' in moderators:
        print(u'The shift-key is down!')
~~~

__Returns:__

A list of keyboard moderators. An empty list is returned if no moderators are pressed.

- Type: list

</div>

<div class="FunctionDoc YAMLDoc" id="Keyboard-show_virtual_keyboard" markdown="1">

## function __Keyboard\.show\_virtual\_keyboard__\(visible=True\)

Shows or hides a virtual keyboard if this is supported by the
back-end. This function is only necessary if you want the virtual
keyboard to remain visible while collecting multicharacter
responses. Otherwise, `Keyboard.get_key()` will implicitly show and
hide the keyboard for a single-character response.

This function does nothing for back-ends that do not support virtual
keyboards.

__Example:__

~~~ .python
my_keyboard = Keyboard()
my_keyboard.show_virtual_keyboard(True)
response1, timestamp2 = my_keyboard.get_key()
response2, timestamp2 = my_keyboard.get_key()
my_keyboard.show_virtual_keyboard(False)
~~~

__Keywords:__

- `visible` -- True if the keyboard should be shown, False otherwise.
	- Type: bool
	- Default: True
