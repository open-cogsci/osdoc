Hi! I am a master's student at the Cognitive Neuropsychology program of the VU university of Amsterdam. I'm currently working on a thesis project in Marseille, and I hope to enroll in a PhD program in the near future.

In the meantime, I'll happily contribute in finding a solution to any problem you might encounter while realizing your experiment (or whatever it is you want to use OpenSesame for - heck, you could even make games with it!)
