I'm working as a PhD student under supervision of Françoise Vitu at the Laboratoire Psychologie Cognitive at the Aix-Marseille Université. My PhD project is on whether affordances (possibilities for action in our environment) influence how and where we move our eyes.

I really enjoy being involved in the OpenSesame project, from helping with the documentation to offering support on the forum. So don't hesitate to post any questions!
