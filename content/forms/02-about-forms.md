##### If you experience performance issues when using forms, see [this post](/forms/performance-issues-and-troubleshooting/).

Forms are simple interactive displays that can be used to implement questionnaires, instructions, text input displays, etc. You can use forms in three ways.

- Use the form plug-ins, such as form_text_input, which offer ready-made forms. This is the easiest, but least flexible way of using forms. [(Read more)][plug-ins]
- Define custom forms using OpenSesame script and the form_base plug-in. This offers considerable flexibility, and does not require any real programming skills. [(Read more)][custom-forms-opensesame-script]
- Create custom forms using Python inline script. This offers the most flexibility, but requires some knowledge of Python programming. [(Read more)][custom-forms-python]
