### CombiTVA

This is an open implementation of the CombiTVA paradigm [(Vangkilde, Bundesen & Coull, 2011)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00213-011-2361-x) in OpenSesame.

### Conjunctive continuous performance task

Conjunctive Continuous Performance Task (CCPT) is a sustained attention test developed and validated by [Shalev et al (2011)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002839321100251X). This is the visual variant of the CCPT implemented in OpenSesame. Available in English and German.

### Implicit association test (IAT)

This is a standard Implicit Association Test created using OpenSesame. It has been adapted to suit creativity research, but you can modify the template for your purposes easily

### Another implicit association test (IAT) 

This is another Implicit Association Test created using OpenSesame. It was designed with adaptability in mind, so you could modify the template for your purposes very easily. It offers several improvements over other IAT versions found at the time of writing, such as better randomization of stimuli, optional secret skip-sequence shortcut key to make development and testing easier, arbitrary ITI, arbitrary number of stimuli per category, using both images and words as stimuli, optional feedback on error, optional error correction, and much more. You should check it out and compare...

### Mini version of the New York Cognition Questionnaire

New York Cognition Questionnaire (NYC-Q) is a questionnaire probing the content and form of self generated thoughts (mindwandering). This is a minimal version of the NYC-Q suitable for using after behavioural tests or resting state fMRI scans. Available in English and German.

### Mouse-tracking

[Spivey, Grosjean and Knoblich (2005)](http://www.pnas.org/content/102/29/10393) introduced the mouse-tracking paradigm, in which participants' mouse trajectories are recorded as they move the cursor from a starting point to click on one of two or more responses. The path of the mouse cursor can be analysed to infer instantaneous attraction towards competing responses over the course of a trial.

## Adding your own task

If you have implemented a task that you feel has a high re-use potential, we want to know about it! You can have your task included in this list in two ways:

1. Edit this page on GitHub, add your experiment, and send a pull request. To do this, you need to have a GitHub account.
	- This page on GitHub: <https://github.com/smathot/osdoc/blob/master/content/standard-tasks.md>
	- Instructions on how to edit a page: [/contribute/documentation](/contribute/documentation)
2. Or drop a note on the forum to let us know about your experiment.
	- <http://www.cogsci.nl/forum/index.php?p=/discussion/823/>

Please provide the following information:

1. A description of your task.
2. A (list of) developer(s).
3. A URL where people can download the task.
4. Citation information.
5. A license, such as the [GPL-3].
