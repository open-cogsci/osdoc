OpenSesame 3.0.6 is the sixth maintenance release in the 3.0 series. It contains bug fixes and minor improvements, and should be a pleasant and safe upgrade for everyone who is using the 3.0 series.

A notable improvement in this release is that we now have a standard OSX package! So no more waiting and using outdated packages for Mackies! Thanks do Daniel Schreij ([@dscreij](https://github.com/dschreij/)) for his great work on this.
