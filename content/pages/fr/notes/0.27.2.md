- Add `mouse.set_pos()` and `mouse.get_pressed()` functions
- Add new plugin API ([link](/plugins/create/))

- Add touch_response plugin

Bugs fixed:

- Warn when form widgets are too small

- Expose more variables to variable inspector
- Change name in script tab on name change
- Fix translation issues in Gabor and noise patches
- Allow capitalization changes when renaming items
- Fix many Unicode errors
