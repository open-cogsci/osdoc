title: Release notes for 3.3.14

## Backwards incompatible changes

- Logging of variables has changed slightly. Specifically, variables that are defined in the user interface, such as columns in a `loop` table or explicitly selected variables in a `logger`, are always logged. Variables that are defined in an `inline_script` or `inline_javascript` are only logged if they are numbers (`int` and `float`), strings (`str` and`bytes`), and `None` values. This is to avoid log files from becoming unreasonably large due to logging of long lists and other large values.
- The content of `<script>` tags in `inline_html` items is not evaluated. This is no longer necessary, because you can simply refer to experimental variables as you would elsewhere in JavaScript.
- Conditional expressions are only interpreted as OpenSesame script if they contain variable references using the square-bracket notation or the words 'always' or 'never'. Otherwise they are interpreted as Python code as described below.
