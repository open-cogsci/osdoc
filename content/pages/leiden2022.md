## Description

In this two-day, hands-on workshop, you will learn how to implement psychological experiments with the open-source software OpenSesame. You will learn:

- How to build and run experiments with OpenSesame
- The limitations and advantages of online and laboratory-based experiments.
- How to parse data collected with OpenSesame

An important aspect of the workshop will also be to help you with things that are directly relevant for your own research. Therefore, each day ends with a Q&A session. To make the most out the workshop, think in advance about what you would like to use OpenSesame for, and what you need help with during this workshop!

If you want to work on your own computer, please install OpenSesame before the workshop. You can download OpenSesame for free from <https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/>. No prior experience with OpenSesame, Python, or JavaScript is required.

We're looking forward to meeting you all!

- 16:00 – 17:00: __Q&A__ What kind of experiment would you like to build for your own research? And what kind of help do you need from us?

Schedule:

- 13:00 – 14:00: __Building an online experiment.__ We will start this session with a general introduction to online experiments. This is followed by a hands-on tutorial in which we will modify the experiment that we created during Day 1 so that it is suitable for running online.
- 14:00 – 15:00: __Using <https://mindprobe.eu> (a JATOS server) to run experiments online.__ In this session, you will learn how to use mindprobe.eu, which is a free server that runs the open-source software JATOS, to actually run an experiment online. A mindprobe.eu account will be provided to each participant.
- Break
- 15:30 – 16:00: __Getting data ready for analysis.__ We will start this session with a general explanation of how data is structured, both for experiments that are conducted online and for experiments that are conducted in a traditional laboratory set-up. Next, we will see how to transform this data into a format that lends itself to statistical analysis. Specifically, we will learn how data from multiple participants can be merged into a single `.csv` spreadsheet; we will also learn how data from an online experiment can be downloaded from JATOS and converted to a `.csv` spreadsheet.
- 16:00 – 17:00: __Q&A__ What kind of experiment would you like to build for your own research? And what kind of help do you need from us?
