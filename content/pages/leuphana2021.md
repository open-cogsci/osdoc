## Description

In this three-day, hands-on, online workshop, you will learn how to implement psychological experiments with the open-source software OpenSesame. You will learn how to run experiments online as well as in a traditional laboratory set-up, and about the limitations and advantages of both approaches. You will also learn how to include eye tracking in laboratory-based experiments. Finally, using the skills that you will learn during the workshop, you will design and implement an experiment for your own research.

Please install OpenSesame on your computer before the workshop. You can download OpenSesame for free from this link:

No prior experience with OpenSesame, Python, or JavaScript is required.

I’m looking forward to meeting you all!

## Program 


### Day 1 (Nov 10): Introduction

- 13:00 – 14:30: __Introduction to OpenSesame__. A general introduction to the software OpenSesame, followed by a hands-on tutorial in which you will learn the basic concepts of the software. [Click here](%url:/tutorials/capybara%) to go to the tutorial.
- Break
- 15:00 – 16:00: __Introduction to OpenSesame (continued)__.
- 16:00 – 17:00: __Free time to develop your own experiment.__ What kind of experiment would you like to build for your own research? You will draft a design for your own experiment, which you will implement during the next two days. Use [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QCUwNuHX5OkadF4kWj0xp9Aj9NDM7WxWJ0q6NBlUWhI/edit?usp=sharing) to indicate which experiment you'd like to create.


### Day 2 (Nov 17): Online experiments

- 13:00 – 14:30: __Building an online time-reproduction task.__ We will start this session with a general introduction to online experiments. This is followed by a hands-on tutorial in which you will implement a time-reproduction task that is suitable for running online.
- Break
- 15:00 – 17:00: __Using <https://mindprobe.eu> (a JATOS server) to run experiments online.__ In this session, you will learn how to use mindprobe.eu, which is a free server that runs the open-source software JATOS, to actually run an experiment online. A mindprobe.eu account will be provided to each participant.
- 16:00 – 17:00: __Free time to develop your own experiment.__ During this session, you will continue to work on your own experiment.


### Day 3 (Nov 24): Eye-tracking experiments

- 13:00 – 14:30: __Building a self-paced reading task with eye-tracking.__ We will start this session with a general introduction to eye tracking. This is followed by a hands-on tutorial in which you will implement a self-paced reading task with basic eye tracking. We will focus on using the EyeLink, which is a specific eye tracker. However, concepts and techniques are largely also applicable to other eye trackers.
Break
- 15:00 – 17:00: __Gaze-contingent eye-tracking.__ You will learn how to implement experiments that react to the eye movements of the participant, that is, gaze-contingent experiments.
- 16:00 – 17:00: __Free time to develop your own experiment.__ During this session, you will continue to work on your own experiment.
- 17:00 – 17:30: __Q&A.__ We will close the workshop with time for questions and remarks.
