## About forms, geometries, and widgets

A form is a set of widgets (buttons, labels, text-input fields, etc.) arranged into a grid with a particular geometry. In the image below you see an example of a 2 (columns) Ã— 3 (rows) form. A form geometry is simple, and consists of the following properties:

- *margins* ensure that the widgets do not touch the edge of the display. You can have different margins for the top, right, bottom, and left.
- *spacing* ensure that the widgets do not touch each other. The horizontal and vertical spacing is the same.
- There are one or more *rows*, possibly of different sizes.
- There are one or more *columns*, possibly of different sizes.

Of course, an empty form is no fun. So let's add the following widgets to create a simple question form:

- A `label` that spans the two columns of the top row. We use this label to give a title to the form.
- Another `label` that spans the two columns of the middle row. This label contains the actual question.
- A `button` in the bottom right widget area. This button allows the user to give the $0.05 response.
- Another `button` in the bottom left widget area. This button allows the user to give the $0.10 response.

The images above are schematic examples. How this form actually looks in OpenSesame depends on your settings (notably your font and colors), but it may look something like this:

## Creating custom forms

There are two ways to create custom forms. You can:

- Use the FORM_BASE item, and specify your form using OpenSesame script.
- Using Python in an INLINE_SCRIPT item. The Python way is slightly more flexible, but for most purposes both ways can be used.

### Creating forms using OpenSesame script

We will create the form described above using OpenSesame script. First, drag the FORM_BASE plugin into your experiment. Click on the newly created item to open its tab. Next, click on the 'Edit script' button (with the terminal icon), in the top-right of the tab area. This will open the script editor. Enter the following script to generate the form described above (see the comments for explanations).

~~~
# Margins are defined as "top;right;bottom;left". Each value corresponds to a
# margin in pixels.
set margins "50;100;50;100"
# The spacing is simply a value in pixels.
set spacing "25"
# The sizes of the rows are relative. "1;2;1" means that there are three rows,
# where the middle one is twice as large as the bottom and top ones. So "1;2;1"
# means exactly the same thing as "3;6;3". Please note that "3" does not mean
# that there are three equally-sized rows (but "1;1;1" does).
set rows "1;2;1"
# Columns are defined in the same way. "1;1" simply means that there
# are two columns of the same size.
set cols "1;1"
# Widgets are defined as follows:
# widget [column] [row] [column span] [row span] [widget type] [keywords]
#
# The columns and rows start counting at 0. If you do not want to have your widget
# span multiple columns and rows, you simply set the column and row span to 1.
widget 0 0 2 1 label text="Question"
widget 0 1 2 1 label center="no" text="A bat and a baseball together cost $1.10. The bat costs one dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?"
widget 0 2 1 1 button text="$0.10"
widget 1 2 1 1 button text="$0.05"
~~~

### Creating forms using Python inline script

The exact same form can be created using an INLINE_SCRIPT and a bit of Python code. You will notice that the Python code somewhat resembles the OpenSesame script shown above. This is no wonder: The FORM_BASE plugin essentially translates the OpenSesame script into Python code.

First, drag an INLINE_SCRIPT into your experiment. Select the newly created item to open its tab, and add the following script into the Run phase of the INLINE_SCRIPT item (see the comments for explanations).

~~~ .python
# Create a form
form = Form(
    cols=[1,1], rows=[1,2,1],
    margins=(50,100,50,100), spacing=25
)
# Create four widgets
labelTitle = Label(text='Question')
labelQuestion = Label(
    text='A bat and a baseball together cost $1.10. The bat costs one dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?',
    center=False
)
button5cts = Button(text='$0.05')
button10cts = Button(text='$0.10')
# Add the widgets to the form. The position in the form is indicated as a
# (column, row) tuple.
form.set_widget(labelTitle, (0,0), colspan=2)
form.set_widget(labelQuestion, (0,1), colspan=2)
form.set_widget(button5cts, (0,2))
form.set_widget(button10cts, (1,2))
# Execute the form! In this case, the form will return the text of the button that
# was clicked. This is one way to get a return value out of the form. Another way
# is to use the 'var' keyword, supported some of the widgets.
button_clicked = form._exec()
~~~

If you want a specific widget to receive the focus when the form is executed, you can use the `focus_wiget` keyword:

~~~ .python
button_clicked = form._exec(focus_widget=button5cts)
~~~

### Non-interactive forms

Usually, a form will have an input field, a button, or some other interactive element. However, you can also use forms without having any interactive element. To do this in OpenSesame script, you set `only_render` to "yes":

```python
set only_render yes
```

To this in a Python INLINE_SCRIPT, you call `form.render()`, instead of `form._exec()`.

### Themes

Forms support theming. Currently, two themes are available: 'gray' and 'plain'. The 'gray' theme is the default. Although the 'gray' theme is already quite plain, the 'plain' theme is even more basic. You can choose a theme like this in OpenSesame script:

```python
set theme plain
```

And by using the `theme` keyword in Python inline script:

~~~ .python
form = Form(theme='plain')
~~~

### Available widgets and keywords

### Validating input

## Another example

The following OpenSesame script (in a FORM_BASE plugin) will produce a questionnaire of three rating scales plus a next button:

```python
set rows "1;1;1;1;1"
set cols "1;1"
widget 0 0 2 1 label text="Indicate how much you agree with the following statements"
widget 0 1 1 1 label center="no" text="Forms are easy"
widget 1 1 1 1 rating_scale var="question1" nodes="Agree;Don't know;Disagree"
widget 0 2 1 1 label center="no" text="I like data"
widget 1 2 1 1 rating_scale var="question2" nodes="Agree;Don't know;Disagree"
widget 0 3 1 1 label center="no" text="I like questionnaires"
widget 1 3 1 1 rating_scale var="question3" nodes="Agree;Don't know;Disagree"
widget 0 4 2 1 button text="Next"
```

The following Python inline_script will produce the same questionnaire.

~~~ .python
form = Form(cols=[1,1], rows=[1,1,1,1,1])
title = Label(
    text='Indicate how much you agree with the following statement'
)
question1 = Label(text='Forms are easy', center=False)
question2 = Label(text='I like data', center=False)
question3 = Label(text='I like questionnaires', center=False)
ratingScale1 = RatingScale(
    var='question1',
    nodes=['Agree', u"Don't know", 'Disagree']
)
ratingScale2 = RatingScale(
    var='question2',
    nodes=['Agree', u"Don't know", 'Disagree']
)
ratingScale3 = RatingScale(var='question3',
    nodes=['Agree', u"Don't know", 'Disagree'])
nextButton = Button(text='Next')
form.set_widget(title, (0, 0), colspan=2)
form.set_widget(question1, (0, 1))
form.set_widget(question2, (0, 2))
form.set_widget(question3, (0, 3))
form.set_widget(ratingScale1, (1, 1))
form.set_widget(ratingScale2, (1, 2))
form.set_widget(ratingScale3, (1, 3))
form.set_widget(nextButton, (0, 4), colspan=2)
form._exec()
~~~

The resulting form looks something like this. (The exact appearance depends on your font, colors, etc.)
