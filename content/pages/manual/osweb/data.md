The downloaded file, typically named in the format `jatos_results_<timestamp>.jzip`, contains various folders and files corresponding to metadata and participant data. This format can be difficult to work with directly for data analysis.

To simplify data analysis, you can convert this file to a more accessible format like `.csv` or `.xlsx`. This conversion can be easily achieved by using the 'Convert OSWeb results to csv/xlsx' option found in the OSWeb extension.
