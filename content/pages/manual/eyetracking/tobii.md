Title: Tobii

PyGaze offers *experimental* support for Tobii eye trackers. To be able to use the Tobii, you need to install OpenSesame in a Python 3.8 environment. This most easily done using Anaconda, as described [here](%url:download%). Next, you need to install the `tobii-research` package:

```
!pip install tobii-research
```
