## About EyeLogic

The eye tracking devices from EyeLogic meet the highest standards in accuracy and precision, required for scientific usage. They excel in providing a low and consistent latency, offer strong robustness as well as a high tolerance of head motion. The exceptionality however lies in the combination of quality criteria in connection with portability and ease of use.
