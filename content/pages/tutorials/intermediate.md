title: Intermediate tutorial (Python) visual search

[TOC]

## About OpenSesame

OpenSesame is a user-friendly program for the development of behavioral experiments for psychology, neuroscience, and experimental economy. For beginners, OpenSesame has a comprehensive graphical, point-and-click interface.  For advanced users, OpenSesame supports Python (desktop only) and JavaScript (desktop and browser).

OpenSesame is freely available under the [General Public License v3][gpl].

## About this tutorial

This tutorial shows how to create a basic visual-search experiment using OpenSesame [(Mathôt, Schreij, & Theeuwes, 2012)][references]. We will use both the graphical interface and Python scripting to develop an experiment that you can run on the desktop in a traditional lab-based setting. Some experience with OpenSesame and Python is recommended. This tutorial takes approximately one hour.

A JavaScript-based version of this tutorial is also available. If you want to run your experiments online in a browser (with OSWeb), then the JavaScript tutorial is what you need:

## The experiment

In this tutorial, you will create a basic visual-search experiment. The experiment resembles the classic visual-search studies of [Treisman and Gelade (1980)][references], but it is not identical.

In this experiment, participants search for a target object, which can be a yellow square, a yellow circle, a blue square, or a blue circle; the identity of the target is varied between blocks of trials. Participants indicate whether the target is present or not by pressing the right (present) or left (absent) arrow key.

In addition to the target, zero or more distractor objects are shown. There are three conditions, and the condition determines what kind of distractors there are:

- In the *Conjunction* condition, distractors can have any shape and color, with the only restriction that distractors cannot be identical to the target. So, for example, if the target is a yellow square, then distractors are yellow circles, blue circles, and blue squares.
- In the *Shape Feature* condition, distractors have a different shape from the target, but can have any color. So, for example, if the target is a yellow square, then distractors are yellow circles and blue circles.
- In the *Color Feature* condition, distractors can have any shape, but have a different color from the target. So, for example, if the target is a yellow square, then distractors are blue squares and blue circles.

Immediate feedback is shown after each trial: a green dot after a correct response, and a red dot after an incorrect response. Detailed feedback on average response times and accuracy is shown after each block of trials.

Experiments like this show two typical findings:

- It takes more time to find the target in the Conjunction condition than in the two Feature conditions.
- In the Conjunction condition, response times increase as the number of distractors increases. This suggests that people search for the target one item at a time; this is called *serial search*.
- In the Feature conditions (both shape and color), response times do not, or hardly, increase as the the number of distractors increases. This suggests that people process the entire display at once; this is called *parallel search*.

According to Treisman and Gelade's feature-integration theory, these results reflect that the Conjunction condition requires that you combine, or *bind*, the color and shape of each object. This binding requires attention, and you therefore need to shift your attention from one object to the next; this is slow, and explains why response times depend on how many objects there are. In contrast, in the Feature conditions, color and shape do not need to be bound, and therefore the whole display can be processed in a single sweep without attention being directed at each and every object.

## Experimental design

This design:

- Is *within-subject*, because all participants do all conditions
- Is *fully crossed* (or full-factorial), because all combinations of conditions occur
- Has three conditions (or factors):
	- Varied within blocks:
		- `set_size` with three levels (1, 5, 15), or SS<sub>3</sub>
		- `condition` with three levels (conjunction, feature_shape, feature_color), or CN<sub>3</sub>
		- `target_present` with two levels (present, absent), or TP<sub>2</sub>
	- Varied between blocks:
		- `target_shape` with two levels (square, circle), or TS<sub>2</sub>
		- `target_color` with two levels (yellow, blue), or TC<sub>2</sub>
- Has N subjects, or <u>S</u><sub>N</sub>

You can write this design as <u>S</u><sub>N</sub>×SS<sub>3</sub>×CN<sub>3</sub>×TP<sub>2</sub>×TS<sub>2</sub>×TC<sub>2</sub>

For more information about this notation for experimental design, see:

- %link:experimentaldesign%

## Step 1: Create the basic structure of the experiment

Start OpenSesame and, in the 'Get started!' tab, select the Extended template. This template provides the basic structure that is common to many cognitive-psychology experiments, such as the one that we will create here.

The Extended template contains a few items that we don't need. Delete the following items:

- *about_this_template*
- *practice_loop*
- *end_of_practice*

When you have deleted these items, they are still visible in the 'Unused items' bin. To permanently delete these items, click on the 'Unused items' bin, and then click on the 'Permanently delete unused items' button.

Finally, give the experiment a good title, such as 'Visual search'. To do this, open the general-properties tab (by clicking on 'Extended template' in the overview area) and click on the experiment name to edit it.

The overview area should now look like %FigStep1:

%--

## Step 2: Define experimental variables that are varied between blocks

As described above, two variables are varied between blocks in our experiment: `target_shape` and `target_color`. We therefore need to define these variables in the *experimental_loop*. To understand why, consider the structure shown in %FigStep1, starting from the bottom (i.e. the most indented level).

- *trial_sequence* corresponds to a single trial
- *block_loop* corresponds to a block of a trials
	- Therefore, variables defined here vary for each run of *trial_sequence*; in other words, variables defined in *block_loop* are varied __within blocks__.
- *block_sequence* corresponds to a block of trials, preceded by resetting of the feedback variables, and followed by participant feedback
- *experimental_loop* corresponds to multiple blocks of trials
	- Therefore, variables defined here vary for each run of *block_sequence*; in other words, variables defined in *experimental_loop* are varied __between blocks__.
- *experiment* corresponds to the entire experimental, which is an instruction screen, followed by multiple blocks of trials, followed by an end-of-experiment screen

Click on experimental loop, and define:

- `target_shape`, which can be 'square' or 'circle'; and
- `target_color`, which can be 'yellow' or 'blue'.

We have a full-factorial design, which means that all 2 × 2 = 4 combinations must occur. The table of *experimental_loop* should now look like %FigStep2:

%--

 id: FigStep2
 source: step2.png

  The table of *experimental_loop* at the end of step 2.
--%

## Step 3: Give instructions at the start of each block

Right now, the experiment starts with a single *instructions* screen. In our case, we want to give instructions before each block of trials, to tell the participant what target to look for (because the identity of the target varies between blocks).

__Move the instructions into block_sequence__

Therefore, pick up the *instructions* item and drag it onto *block_sequence*. A pop-up will appear, asking you if you want to:

- Insert the item into *block_sequence*, in which case *instructions* would become the first item of *block_sequence*; or
- Insert the item after *block_sequence*, in which case *instructions* would move to a position after *block_sequence*.

Select the first option ('Insert into'). Now *block_sequence* starts with an instructions screen, which is what we want.

__Add instructional text__

Click on *instructions* to open it, and add a good instructional text, such as:

```text
INSTRUCTIONS

Search for the {target_color} {target_shape}

Press the right-arrow key if you find it
Press the left-arrow key if you don't

Press any key to begin
```

The curly braces brackets around '{target_color}' and '{target_shape}' indicate that these are not literal text, but refer to the variables that we have defined in *experimental_loop*. When the experiment runs, the values of these variables will appear here, and the participant will see (for example), 'Search for the yellow circle'.

__Give a visual preview of the target__

It also good to show the participant the actual stimulus that she needs to find. To do this:

- Draw a filled circle at the center of the display (make sure it doesn't overlap with the text);
- Change the color of the circle to '{target_color}'. This means that the color of the circle depends on the value of the variable `target_color`; and
- Change the show-if expression to `target_shape == 'circle'`. This is a Python expression that checks if the variable `target_shape` has the value 'circle'.

In other words, we have drawn a circle of which the color is determined by `target_color`; furthermore, this circle is only shown when the variable `target_shape` has the value 'circle'. For more information about variables and show-if statements, see:

- %link:manual/variables%

We use the same trick to draw a square:

- Draw a filled square at the center of the display;
- Change the color of the square to '{target_color}'; and
- Change the show-if statement to `target_shape == 'square'`

The *instructions*  screen should now look like %FigStep3:

%--

  The *instructions* screen at the end of step 3.
--%

## Step 4: Define experimental variables that are varied within blocks

Three variables are varied within blocks in our experiment: `condition`, `set_size`, and `target_present`. As described under Step 2, we need to define these variables in the *block_loop* so that they vary for each run of *trial_sequence*.

The three variables make a total of 3 × 3 × 2 = 18 different combinations. We can type these into the table manually, but, because we have full-factorial design, we can also use the full-factorial-design wizard. To do this, first open *block_loop* and click on the 'Full-factorial design' button.

In the table that appears, put the variable names on the first row, and the values on the rows below, as shown in %FigFullFactorial.

%--

Now click on 'Ok' to generate the full design. The table of *block_loop* should now look like %FigStep4.

## Step 5: Create the trial sequence

We want our trial sequence to look as follows:

- A fixation dot, for which we will use a SKETCHPAD.
- A search display, which we will create in Python with a custom INLINE_SCRIPT.
- Response collection, for which we will use a KEYBOARD_RESPONSE.
- Data logging, for which we will use a LOGGER.
- (We also want immediate feedback after each trial, but we will get back to this later.)

So the only thing that is missing is an INLINE_SCRIPT.

- Insert a new INLINE_SCRIPT after *sketchpad* and rename it to *search_display_script*.
- Rename *sketchpad* to *fixation_dot*, so that its function is clear; and
- Change the duration of *fixation_dot* to 500, so that the fixation dot is shown for 500 ms. (There should already be a fixation dot drawn; if not, draw one in the center of *fixation_dot*.)

The overview area should now look like %FigStep5.

## Step 6: Generate the search display

__Top-down and defensive programming__

Now things will get interesting: We will start programming in Python. We will use two guiding principles: *top-down* and *defensive* programming.

- *Top-down programming* means that we start with the most abstract logic, without bothering with how this logic is implemented. Once the most abstract logic is in place, we will move down to a slightly less abstract logic, and so on, until we arrive at the details of the implementation. This technique helps to keep the code structured.
- *Defensive programming* means that we assume that we make mistakes. Therefore, to protect us from ourselves, we build sanity checks into the code.

*Note:* The explanation below assumes that you're somewhat familiar with Python code. If concepts like `list`, `tuple`, and functions don't mean anything to you, then it's best to first walk through an introductory Python tutorial, such as this one:

- <https://pythontutorials.eu/>

The logic of the code is shown in %FigHierarchy. The numbers indicate the order in which we will implement the functionality, starting at the abstract level.

__The Prepare and Run phases__

Open *search_display_script* and switch to the Prepare tab. OpenSesame distinguishes two phases of execution:

- During the Prepare phase, each item is given the opportunity to prepare itself; what this means depends on the item: For a SKETCHPAD, it means drawing a canvas (but not showing it); for a SAMPLER, it means loading a sound file (but not playing it); etc.
- During the Run phase, each item is actually executed; again, what this means depends on the item: For a SKETCHPAD, it means showing the previously prepared canvas; for a SAMPLER, it means playing a previously loaded sound file.

For an INLINE_SCRIPT, you have to decide yourself what to put in the Prepare phase, and what to put in the Run phase. The distinction is usually quite clear: In our case, we put the code for drawing the canvas in the Prepare phase, and the code for showing the canvas (which is small) in the Run phase.

See also:

- %link:prepare-run%

__Implement the abstract level__

We start at the most abstract level: defining a function that draws a visual-search display. We don't specify *how* this is done; we simply assume that there is a function that does this, and we will worry about the details later—that's top-down programming.

In the Prepare tab, enter the following code:

~~~ .python
c = draw_canvas()
~~~

What happens here? We …

- Call `draw_canvas()`, which returns a `Canvas` object that we store as `c`; in other words, `c` is a `Canvas` object that corresponds the search display. This assumes that there is a function `draw_canvas()`, even though we haven't defined it yet.

A `Canvas` object is a single display; it is, in a sense, the Python counterpart of a SKETCHPAD. See also:

- %link:manual/python/canvas%

We now go one step down by defining `draw_canvas()` (above the rest of the script so far):

~~~ .python
def draw_canvas():
    """Draws the search canvas.

    Returns
    -------
    Canvas
    """
    c = Canvas()
    xy_list = xy_random(n=set_size, width=500, height=500, min_dist=75)
    if target_present == 'present':
        x, y = xy_list.pop()
        draw_target(c, x, y)
    elif target_present != 'absent':
        raise Exception(f'Invalid value for target_present: {target_present}')
    for x, y in xy_list:
        draw_distractor(c, x, y)
    return c
~~~


What happens here? We …

- Create an empty canvas, `c`, using the factory function `Canvas()`.
- Generate a list of random `x, y` coordinates, called `xy_list`, using another common function, `xy_random()`. This list determines where the stimuli are shown.
- Check if the experimental variable `target_present` has the value 'present'; if so, `pop()` one `x, y` tuple from `xy_list`, and draw the target at this location. This assumes that there is a function `draw_target()`, even though we haven't defined it yet.
- If `target_present` is neither 'present' nor 'absent', we raise an `Exception`; this is defensive programming, and protects us from typos (e.g. if we had accidentally entered 'presenr' instead of 'present').
- Loop through all remaining `x, y` tuples and draw a distractor at each position. This assumes that there is a function `draw_distractor()`, even though we haven't defined it yet.
- Return `c`, which now has the search display drawn onto it.

There are several common functions, such as `Canvas()` and `xy_random()`, which are always available. See:

- %link:manual/python/common%

Experimental variables are global variables. That's why you can refer to `set_size`, which is defined in *block_loop*, even though the variable `set_size` is never explicitly defined in the script. The same is true for `target_shape`, `target_color`, `condition`, etc. See:

- %link:var%

__Implement the intermediate level__

We now go one more step down by defining `draw_target` (above the rest of the script so far):

~~~ .python
def draw_target(c, x, y):
    """Draws the target.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c: Canvas
    x: int
    y: int
    """
    draw_shape(c, x, y, color=target_color, shape=target_shape)
~~~

What happens here? We …

- Call another function, `draw_shape()`, and specify the color and shape that needs to be drawn. This assumes that there is a function `draw_shape()`, even though we haven't defined it yet.

We also define `draw_distractor` (above the rest of the script so far):

~~~ .python
def draw_distractor(c, x, y):
    """Draws a single distractor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c: Canvas
    x: int
    y: int
    """
    if condition == 'conjunction':
        draw_conjunction_distractor(c, x, y)
    elif condition == 'feature_shape':
        draw_feature_shape_distractor(c, x, y)
    elif condition == 'feature_color':
        draw_feature_color_distractor(c, x, y)
    else:
        raise Exception(f'Invalid condition: {condition}')
~~~

What happens here? We …

- Call another function to draw a more specific distractor depending on the Condition.
- Check whether `condition` has any of the expected values. If not, we raise an `Exception`. This is defensive programming! Without this check, if we made a typo somewhere, the distractor might simply not be shown without causing an error message.

Now we define the function that draws distractors in the Conjunction condition (above the rest of the script so far):

~~~ .python
import random


def draw_conjunction_distractor(c, x, y):
    """Draws a single distractor in the conjunction condition: an object that
    can have any shape and color, but cannot be identical to the target.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c: Canvas
    x: int
    y: int
    """
    conjunctions = [('yellow', 'circle'),
                    ('blue',   'circle'),
                    ('yellow', 'square'),
                    ('blue',   'square')]
    conjunctions.remove((target_color, target_shape))
    color, shape = random.choice(conjunctions)
    draw_shape(c, x, y, color=color, shape=shape)
~~~

What happens here? We …

- Define a list, `conjunctions`, of all possible color and shape combinations.
- Remove the target from this list; this is necessary, because the distractor cannot be identical to the target.
- Randomly select one of the color and shape combinations from `conjunctions`.
- Call another function, `draw_shape()`, and specify the color and shape of the to-be-drawn distractor. This assumes that there is a function `draw_shape()`, even though we haven't defined it yet.

In addition, we …

- Add the line `import random` to the top of the script. This is necessary so that we can use functions that are part of the `random` module, such as `random.choice()`.

Now we define the function that draws distractors in the Shape Feature condition (right below the `import` statement):

~~~ .python
def draw_feature_shape_distractor(c, x, y):
    """Draws a single distractor in the feature-shape condition: an object that
    has a different shape from the target, but can have any color.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c: Canvas
    x: int
    y: int
    """
    colors = ['yellow', 'blue']
    color = random.choice(colors)
    if target_shape == 'circle':
        shape = 'square'
    elif target_shape == 'square':
        shape = 'circle'
    else:
        raise Exception(f'Invalid target_shape: {target_shape}')
    draw_shape(c, x, y, color=color, shape=shape)
~~~

What happens here? We …

- Randomly select a color.
- Choose a square shape if the target is a circle, and a circle shape if the target is square.
- If `target_shape` is neither 'circle' nor 'square', raise an `Exception`—more defensive programming!
- Call another function, `draw_shape()`, and specify the color and shape of the to-be-drawn distractor. This assumes that there is a function `draw_shape()`, even though we haven't defined it yet.

Now we define the function that draws distractors in the Color Feature condition (right below the `import` statement):

~~~ .python
def draw_feature_color_distractor(c, x, y):
    """Draws a single distractor in the feature-color condition: an object that
    has a different color from the target, but can have any shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c: Canvas
    x: int
    y: int
    """
    shapes = ['circle', 'square']
    shape = random.choice(shapes)
    if target_color == 'yellow':
        color = 'blue'
    elif target_color == 'blue':
        color = 'yellow'
    else:
        raise Exception(f'Invalid target_color: {target_color}')
    draw_shape(c, x, y, color=color, shape=shape)
~~~

What happens here? We …

- Randomly select a shape.
- Choose a blue color if the target is yellow, and a yellow color if the target is blue.
- If `target_color` is neither 'yellow' nor 'blue', raise an `Exception`—more defensive programming!
- Call another function, `draw_shape()`, and specify the color and shape of the to-be-drawn distractor. This assumes that there is a function `draw_shape()`, even though we haven't defined it yet.

__Implement the detailed level__

Now we go all the way down to the details by defining the function that actually draws a shape to the canvas (right below the `import` statement):

~~~ .python
def draw_shape(c, x, y, color, shape):
    """Draws a single shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c: Canvas
    x: int
    y: int
    color: str
    shape: str
    """
    if shape == 'square':
        c += Rect(x=x-25, y=y-25, w=50, h=50, color=color, fill=True)
    elif shape == 'circle':
        c += Circle(x=x, y=y, r=25, color=color, fill=True)
    else:
        raise Exception(f'Invalid shape: {shape}')
    if color not in ['yellow', 'blue']:
        raise Exception(f'Invalid color: {color}')
~~~

What happens here? We …

- Check which shape should be drawn. For squares, we add a `Rect()` element to the canvas. For circles, we add a `Circle()` element.
- Check if the the shape is either a square or a circle, and if not raise an `Exception`. This is another example of defensive programming! We're making sure that we haven't accidentally specified an invalid shape.
- Check if the the color is neither yellow nor blue, and if not raise an `Exception`.

__Implement the Run phase__

Because we have done all the hard work in the Prepare phase, the Run phase is just:

~~~ .python
c.show()
~~~

That's it! Now you have drawn a full visual-search display. And, importantly, you have done so in a way that is easy to understand, because of top-down programming, and safe, because of defensive programming.


## Step 7: Define the correct response

To know if the participant responds correctly, we need to know the correct response. You can define this explicitly in the *block_loop* (as done in the beginner tutorial); but here we're going to use a simple Python script that checks whether the target is present or not, and defines the correct response accordingly.

To do this, insert a new INLINE_SCRIPT at the start of *trial_sequence*, and rename it to *correct_response_script*. In the Prepare phase (not the Run phase!), enter the following code:

~~~ .python
if target_present == 'present':
    correct_response = 'right'
elif target_present == 'absent':
    correct_response = 'left'
else:
    raise Exception(f'target_present should be absent or present, not {target}')
~~~

What happens here? We …

- Check whether the target is present or not. If the target is present, the correct response is 'right' (the right arrow key); if the target is absent, the correct response is 'left' (the left arrow key). The experimental (global) variable `correct_response` is automatically recognized by *keyboard_response*; therefore, we don't need to explicitly indicate that this variable contains the correct response.
- Check if the target is either present or absent, and if not raise an `Exception`—another example of defensive programming.

## Step 8: Give per-trial feedback

Feedback after every trial can motivate participants; however, per-trial feedback should not interfere with the flow of the experiment. A good way to give per-trial feedback is to briefly show a green fixation dot after a correct response, and a red fixation dot after an incorrect response.

To do this:

- Insert two new SKETCHPADs into *trial_sequence*, just after *keyboard_response*.
- Rename one SKETCHPAD to *green_dot*, draw a central green fixation dot onto it, and change its duration to 500.
- Rename the other SKETCHPAD to *red_dot*, draw a central red fixation dot onto it, and change its duration to 500.

Of course, only one of the two dots should be shown on each trial. To accomplish this, we will specify run-if expressions in *trial_sequence*:

- Change the run-if expression for *green_dot* to 'correct == 1', indicating that it should only be shown after a correct response.
- Change the run-if expression for *red_dot* to 'correct == 0', indicating that it should only be shown after an incorrect response.

The variable `correct` is automatically created if the variable `correct_response` is available; that's why we defined `correct_response` in step 7. For more information about variables and run-if statements, see:

- %link:manual/variables%

The *trial_sequence* should now look like %FigStep8.

## Finished!

Congratulations, the experiment is complete! You can give it a test run by pressing on the blue double-arrow button (shortcut: `Ctrl+W`).

If the experiment doesn't work on the first try: Don't worry, and calmly figure out where the mistake comes from. Crashes are part of the normal development process. But you can save yourself a lot of time and headache by working in a structured way, as we have done in this tutorial.
