The xpyriment back-end is built on top of [Expyriment][http://www.expyriment.org], a library that has been designed specifically for creating cognitive and neuroscientific experiments. It is a light-weight hardware-accelerated back-end with excellent timing properties. If you care about temporal precision, but do not plan on generating complex stimuli (i.e. Gabor patches, random-dot gratings, etc.) xpyriment is a good choice.
