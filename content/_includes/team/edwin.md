I'm currently a master student of Neuroscience and Cognition, as well as a research and teaching assistant at Utrecht University. For the OpenSesame project, I have bundled OpenSesame with a portable version of Python, resulting in OpenSesame Portable. Apart from this, I help with plugin development (e.g. the joystick plugin and dummy functionality for the eyelink plugins). Being young and idealistic, I am a strong believer of the principles of open source software. I think OpenSesame is a great example of how open source software can really be a good alternative to - often very expensive - commercial software.
