I have always had a fond interest in both technology and human cognition and therefore chose to study 
Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is a combination of these two disciplines. During this time, I was mainly drawn towards the 
'what makes people tick' side of AI and this led me to follow a master's degree in Cognitive Science.
In this area, I also graduated for my PhD Degree at the VU University of Amsterdam, where I currently work as a post-doc.
During all this time, I never lost my interest in computer science and kept up to speed with the latest developments in this area.
I am happy I can assist Sebastiaan in the development of OpenSesame, as it allows to keep doing more pragmatic tasks like software development 
which I really like, and at the same time lets me stay involved in psychological research.
