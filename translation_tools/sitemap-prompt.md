I want to translate text for OpenSesame, a program for developing psychology experiments. Can you recursively translate the keys in the following YAML to Spanish? Don't translate the values, only the keys. All values should be prefixed with `es/`. For example, `Download: download` should become `Descargar: es/download`. Don't translate technical terms or terms that have a special meaning within OpenSesame, such as sketchpad, mouse_response, keyboard_response, sampler, synth, logger, coroutines, advanced_delay, repeat_cycle, inline_script, inline_javascript, form_base, form_consent, form_text_input, form_text_display, and form_html, 

Respond with a single code block that contains only the translation, without any additional text.

```yaml

```
